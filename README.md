# TicTacToe
Work in progress

The game works but still need to make the computer choose and 'intelligent' move...
  1. Check the board to see if there is a move that would result in the computer winning. If so, make that move.
  2. Check the board to see if there is a move that would block the human from winning. If so, make that move.
  3. Else, choose the best square in the order 4, 0, 2, 6, 8, 1, 3, 5, 7.
